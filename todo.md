# Social Credit System

## Database
- <span style="text-decoration: underline"> user id</span> nickname, points
- One time stuff
  - User id with booleans
- 


## Edge cases
- Renaming
  - minus points when points wrong
- name at the moment too long to add points
  - adding points a problem there too?
- New people joining
  - people leaving and joining

## Vote Manipulation
If User gets + a lot of times the last few minutes:  
Make button with Ignore, Remove x points by pressing


## cleaning up
- save everyones nickname
  - like last year
- use multiple bots


## Manual cmds
- change credit
- disable automatic stuff if it doesnt work as intended anymore or limits bot with ratelimit too much?

## ML stuff
- add text obscenity detection
- Maybe add image nsfw detection?
